      <h2>üîç Learning About Problem Identification and Innovation</h2>
      <p class="summary">Discovering how deeper exploration and real-world validation shape impactful solutions.</p>
      <p>
        Through SECIP 2025, I gained a stronger appreciation for the importance of identifying the <strong>root causes</strong> of a problem before proposing solutions. One key moment was our <em>Problem-Solution Tree</em> exercise, which helped us uncover the underlying issues behind single-use plastic in food delivery. What initially seemed like a simple problem turned out to be tied to factors like user habits, convenience, and infrastructure limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our solution‚Äî<strong>ReCircle</strong>, a reusable container system‚Äîwas born from this deeper exploration. I learned that innovation isn‚Äôt just about being creative; it‚Äôs about aligning ideas with real-world needs, user behaviors, and feasibility. We took into account logistics, stakeholder feedback, and sustainability throughout the design. Regular input from mentors and peers helped us continuously refine our concept into something more scalable and impactful.

      <h2>üåü Personal Reflections on the SECIP Experience</h2>
      <p class="summary">Embracing diversity, building confidence, and growing through teamwork and time pressure.</p>
      <p>
        Collaborating with teammates from various cultural and academic backgrounds was a standout experience. Each person offered unique perspectives, especially when adapting our idea to suit both Malaysian and Indonesian contexts. It made me realize how <strong>culture influences user needs</strong>‚Äîa key lesson for any future innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing our time during ideation and prototyping was challenging. We had to balance creative brainstorming with practical pitch preparation. This experience pushed me to <strong>prioritize, communicate clearly</strong>, and simplify complex concepts for diverse audiences, including mentors and judges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm proud of my contribution to our final pitch‚Äîespecially in articulating the risk management strategy and stakeholder analysis. More than anything, I‚Äôve grown more confident and comfortable taking leadership roles during discussions. This journey taught me how to combine technical thinking with real-world application.
