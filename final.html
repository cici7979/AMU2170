      <h2>üîç Learning About Problem Identification and Innovation</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout SECIP 2025, I learned that clearly identifying a problem is crucial for developing effective innovations. Using human-centered design and empathy helped me understand the real needs behind the issue of plastic waste in food delivery. The process taught me to look beyond surface symptoms and consider cultural, social, and environmental contexts to create meaningful solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing the ReCircle innovation reinforced the importance of balancing creativity with feasibility. Managing risks such as health and safety, user participation, and recycling logistics required thoughtful planning and collaboration. This experience deepened my appreciation for iterative prototyping and the value of feedback from mentors and peers.

      <h2>üåü Personal Reflections on the SECIP Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Over the two weeks, the most meaningful aspect was working with a diverse, passionate team. The cross-cultural collaboration enriched my perspective and made our solution more inclusive and relevant. I found satisfaction in seeing our ideas evolve from abstract concepts to a concrete, scalable plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my greatest challenges was managing time effectively to balance ideation, prototyping, and pitch preparation under tight deadlines. I also learned to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely, which was essential during our pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among my significant achievements, I am proud of contributing to a well-structured pitch that highlighted risk management and scalability. I also value the personal growth in teamwork, problem-solving, and adapting solutions for cultural relevance.
