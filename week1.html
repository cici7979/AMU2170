      <h2>ðŸ“˜ Key Concepts and Approaches</h2>
      <p>
        In Week 1 of <strong>SECIP 2025</strong>, we were introduced to the foundations of <strong>social innovation and entrepreneurship</strong>. Through workshops and interactive activities, I learned key concepts like <em>human-centered design</em>, <em>systems thinking</em>, and <strong>design thinking</strong>. These tools helped us understand how to approach complex social issues from multiple perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emphasis on the <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong> provided a global context for our work. I found the empathy mapping and stakeholder analysis particularly meaningful, as they helped us frame problems based on real-world experiences and needs.
      </p>

      <h2>ðŸ§  Team Decisions and My Role</h2>
      <p>
        Our team, consisting of members from Malaysia, China, India, and Indonesia, decided to tackle the issue of <strong>"Selling Waste to Reduce Pollution"</strong>. This decision was made after considering problems that affect multiple countries and could benefit from a circular economy approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I shared insights from my experience in <strong>Germany</strong>, where supermarkets incentivize recycling by refunding customers who return plastic bottles. This example shaped our early thinking about community-based waste solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I contributed to framing our problem statement and participated actively during the empathy mapping and brainstorming sessions. I also helped prepare the slide deck and designed a simple survey for understanding restaurant waste disposal practices.

      <h2>ðŸŒ± What I Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Empathy mapping:</strong> It taught me the importance of truly understanding user needs before designing solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Team dynamics and communication:</strong> Creating a team charter early on helped avoid misunderstandings and built trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid prototyping:</strong> The hands-on activity (building a lamp prototype) taught me how simple materials can communicate complex ideas effectively.</li>
      </ul>
