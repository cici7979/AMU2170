      <h2>üöß Ideation & Implementation Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Week 2 brought a new set of challenges as we transitioned from brainstorming to building a tangible solution. One major hurdle was aligning our diverse ideas‚Äîsome teammates favored tech-based approaches, while others leaned toward community-driven initiatives. We also struggled with narrowing down features to fit the limited time and resources available for our prototype.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these challenges, we held focused team discussions and used decision matrices to evaluate each idea‚Äôs impact and feasibility. Regular feedback from mentors helped us prioritize features that were both innovative and practical for our target users. Open communication and a willingness to compromise were key to keeping our team united and moving forward.

      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è From Idea to Prototype & Pitch</h2>
      <p>
        Our team‚Äôs process began with mapping user journeys and identifying pain points in plastic container waste management. We settled on a tech-enabled deposit-return system supported by pop-up return booths and an app-based rewards program. My main contributions included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordinating the development of our pitch deck and refining our business model canvas</li>
        <li>Drafting clear messaging on risk management and user incentives</li>
        <li>Helping design the app wireframes and user flow for the prototype</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We divided tasks based on each member‚Äôs strengths, which allowed us to quickly iterate on our prototype. I also took the lead in rehearsing our pitch, ensuring our narrative was concise and compelling for the judges.

      <h2>üå± Key Learnings and Growth</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Adapting to Local Context:</strong> Mentor feedback highlighted the importance of addressing cultural attitudes towards reusing containers in India. This pushed us to rethink our messaging and design, making our solution more sensitive and relevant to our users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Effective Communication:</strong> Distilling complex ideas into a simple, engaging pitch was a valuable skill I developed. It taught me how to focus on what matters most for our audience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterative Prototyping:</strong> Rapidly testing and refining our ideas through feedback loops helped us build confidence and improve our final product.
        </li>

      <h2>üèÜ Achievements & Areas for Improvement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Proud Moments:</strong> Our team delivered a confident and well-structured pitch, receiving positive feedback on our business model and risk management strategies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Room to Grow:</strong> We could further improve our time management and allocate more time for user testing. Personally, I aim to be even more concise in presentations and ensure everyone‚Äôs ideas are voiced during group work.
