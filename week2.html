      <h2>üß† Ideation & Implementation Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        During Week 2 of the intensive program, our team encountered several key challenges, particularly in refining our solution and ensuring it could realistically work in the real world. One major challenge was designing a rewards system that keeps users engaged while still being cost-effective. Initially, our reward system lacked immediacy and didn‚Äôt fully consider user motivation. Thanks to our mentor‚Äôs feedback, we pivoted to make rewards instant and points-based, which we believe will help retain user engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another challenge was defining how the business would be sustainable and scalable. We struggled to clearly outline how we would make a profit and manage logistics like sanitisation and delivery. Through team discussions and the mentor session, we worked together to break down our cost structure and potential revenue streams, such as selling sanitized containers or partnering with eco-conscious restaurants.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also had difficulty estimating operational steps, such as how the returned containers would be processed. We overcame this by brainstorming during our teamwork session and breaking the system into smaller components: logistics, sanitisation, sorting, and delivery.
      </p>

      <h2>üîç Our Process: From Idea to Pitch</h2>
      <p>
        Our team worked in phases: first, refining the core idea, then developing a simple prototype and finally building a compelling pitch. Mentor insights played a huge role in shaping our approach. For instance, they advised us to explore forward and backward integration strategies ‚Äî like creating our own caf√© that uses the containers or investing in our own recycling processes. These suggestions helped us think beyond just an app and toward building a full ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then conducted deeper research, such as preparing to survey restaurant owners to learn about their preferences and whether they‚Äôd accept biodegradable packaging. This helped us improve both the business model and our impact strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for my own contribution, I helped organise and polish the presentation slides, contributed to the environmental impact research, and made sure our storytelling approach flowed logically. I also helped design the survey form for restaurants to gather insights on their preferences and openness to recycled or biodegradable packaging. Lastly, I supported time-keeping during our pitch practice sessions, although we still had one teammate slightly overrun during the final presentation.

        <h2>üìë Project Presentation: ReCircle</h2>
        <p>
            Here's the presentation slide our group <strong>Asia Oceanie Powers (AOP)</strong> prepared for our ReCircle project. It summarizes our problem statement, solution concept, and impact strategy.

      <h2>üå± Key Learnings and Growth</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Value of Expert Feedback:</strong> Our mentor highlighted gaps in profitability and cost structure we hadn‚Äôt considered. Their feedback on integration strategies and cost breakdowns taught us how important it is to think ahead ‚Äî not just about launching a project, but about maintaining and scaling it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pitching & Storytelling Techniques:</strong> We learned that a good idea alone isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äî the way we communicate and present it matters. Practicing storytelling techniques before the presentation helped us frame our solution in a way that connects emotionally with the audience. This will be extremely helpful in future real-world pitching situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Teamwork & Communication:</strong> Although we divided tasks equally and collaborated well, our biggest takeaway is the importance of managing time during a pitch. One teammate exceeded their time, which pushed us over the 5-minute limit. It was a minor error, but a valuable lesson in time discipline for group presentations.
        </li>
